**darts** is a minimalistic skeleton for a Monte Carlo ray tracer, written in C++17. The name is an acronym for _The Dartmouth Academic Ray Tracer Skeleton_ while also being a nod to the random dart-throwing-like process involved in Monte Carlo ray tracing. It runs on recent versions of Windows, Linux, and macOS and provides the foundation for the programming assignments in [Dartmouth's CS 87/287 Rendering Algorithms course](https://cs87-dartmouth.github.io/Fall2022).
